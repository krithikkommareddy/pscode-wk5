// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

a
a/2 = remainder

ask for a number

if the reaminder is 0 print even else print odd


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(a+b+c+d+e)/5
[a,b,c,d,e]
ask for 5 numbers
add the 5 numbers and then divide by 5
convert the input to a list
compare the first number in the list with the remaining numbers and get the minimum and maximum 
print on the screen the average of 5 numbers, and minimum and maximum of the entered 5 numbers
